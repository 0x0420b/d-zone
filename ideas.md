# Ideas

## Meta
* When a user sends a message, "gems" burst out of it and fall in the world which are collected by everyone
  * Gem count per message is based on message length
  * Type of gems based on content of message? (URL, certain words, use of caps/punctuation, emoji)
* Some large perpetual project that is constructed/destroyed by the actors over time
  * Progress controlled/stored on server
  * Influenced by activity in chat
* **Users can play games with each other that are shown in the web view**

## Misc
*  ~~Radio tower that represents connection to server, with a small light that blinks whenever any data is received~~
* Animated star field in background
* Commands that can be sent via chat (list of commands shown in browser app)
  * Change color of actor
* Headphones on users that are in voice
